        "Cherry MX2A RGB Blue Last Update: 09/03/2023\n\nNotes Push Feel For all of the changes made to the molds and designs by Cherry for their MX2A switch platform, the RGB Blues appear to have benefitted the least from these changes. Partly due to their click jacket mechanism and partly due to not receiving any factory lube around their bottom housing ‘socket dome’, these Blues feel crunchy, plasticky, and wholly inconsistent. Their only saving grace in terms of the push feeling is the subtly and fairly firm bottoming out in these switches.\n\nWobble The Cherry MX2A RGB Blues have a slightly greater E/W direction stem wobble than N/S direction that is almost certainly not likely to notice the majority of keyboard enthusiasts. As well, the noted top housing budging in the Cherry MX2A RGB Blacks is also seen here across the full batch of Blues which I received.\n\nSound This section may as well be copied and pasted from any other click jacket clicky switch scorecard I’ve had posted to date. While these switches are seemingly devoid of noise in the housing collisions and don’t have a scratchy tone to their stroke, the mechanism in and of itself provides enough plasticky, grinding, and utterly unpredictable chaos to the switch that shows that even this mechanism has yet to be improved by Cherry decades after it was first implemented.\n\nContext While Cherry does deserve some credit for the changes that were made to the MX2A line as a whole, as well as their implied long-term support for this switch platform, uncertainty as to the price point of these switches remains a big question determining their future success.\n\nOther For all the changes that were made in the MX2A platform launch, the MX2A Blues are severely lacking in the dedicated, mechanism-intensive upgrades they’ve been needing for some years.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX2A RGB Black Last Update: 08/27/2023\n\nNotes Push Feel Boasting new factory lubrication in the bottom housings as well as internal tweaks to reduce friction, the stock Cherry MX2A RGB Black switches are slightly smoother than their MX predecessors while still having a decent amount of medium-grain scratch. Concentrated at the upper portions of the stroke due the factory lubrication in the base of the bottom housings, the stroke is subtly two-toned in feeling which is only further accentuated by a slightly firmer bottoming out than topping out housing collision. The noted disparities here both do improve with breaking in and aftermarket modification as well as get worse at higher actuation speeds.\n\nWobble Clearly made from different molds than the Cherry MX ‘New Nixies’, the MX2A RGB Blacks have a greater E/W direction stem wobble than N/S direction which likely won’t bother the majority of keyboard enthusiasts. As well, there is the tiniest of top housing budges in both directions which is unlikely to affect their general day-to-day usage but is still worth noting.\n\nSound The sound is perhaps the worst aspect of the Cherry MX2A RGB Black switches, as the two-tone stroke and scratch sounds are incredibly apparent in stock form and become increasingly more aggressive at higher actuation speeds. That being said, though, the housing collisions are at least fairly muted and the switches seem free from high-pitched, metallic ping across any batch.\n\nContext With some uncertainty as to their explicit price point, there is some question as to how prevalent these will be within the custom community. What is not up for debate, though, is the longevity and implied company backing. Even if small, Cherry has clearly dedicated themselves to the MX2A changes and should be applauded for the transparency with such.\n\nOther While the MX2A changes are subtle in magnitude, they speak volumes for the large changes Cherry is willing to make to improve their otherwise untouched golden product line.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX ‘New Nixie’ (Black Clear-Top) Last Update: 12/04/2022\n\nNotes Push Feel This is perhaps the singular scorecard which has made me question my decision to not include break in notes in the overall scores. That being said, out of the box the Cherry MX ‘New Nixies’ are an all-around improved version of the average Cherry linear. Very small grain scratch size as well as a firm, muted bottoming out are on par with the average linear switch as of the time of this review, with the slightly less firm, plasticky topping out providing a bit of a different feel.\n\nWobble The wobble, both in terms of single-switch and batch-wide performances is quite damn impressive by Cherry. Little stem wobble in the E/W and even less in the N/S direction provides an experience that very few if anyone in the community would likely have an issue with.\n\nSound While Cherry has done well to remove their classically expected trait of spring ping via the addition of a slightly lubed spring base from the factory, the out of the box sound is still a bit marred from the thinner topping out and scratchy sound. These definitely sound like a lighter, less robust and developed Cherry MX Black out of the box.\n\nContext Priced at a pretty reasonable for time of release $0.60 per switch, these have all the making of a cornerstone, history defining moment in switch history. Their widespread stock, insane community hype, and momentous release from a manufacturer who hasn’t engaged the niche hobby like this ever before will likely see hundreds upon thousands of custom boards built with these switches in the years to come, even if they aren’t the absolute best performing switches.\n\nOther The hype buildup, the noted deliberate improvements by Cherry, and the first of a kind engagement with the community makes these switches ones that won’t be forgotten. I can’t think of any switch, any release, or any story as big as this has been in switch history.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX Purple Last Update: 01/07/2024\n\nNotes Push Feel Modeled directly after the stems used in Cherry MX Clear switches, the MX Purples have a medium strength tactile bump that is on the shorter end of width and located about 30% of the way into downstroke of the switch. Capped on either end of this stroke by dampened, thick housing collisions, the MX Purples are a well-insulated, incredibly inoffensive medium tactile switch that is very much in line with tropes common to Cherry’s switches – including a leathery scratch feeling that is present even behind Cherry’s MX2A lubrication process.\n\nWobble With ever so slightly improved mold designs and tolerances in line with other Cherry MX2A switches, the MX Purples have a decent amount of E/W direction stem wobble and a lesser N/S direction wobble. It’s not likely to bother most users except those most sensitive to wobble.\n\nSound Much like the push feeling notes above, the Cherry MX Purples are on the much more muted, subtle, and dampened side and hardly make much noise at all. What sound is present besides the thuds at bottoming and topping out are that of a medium grained scratch that is leathery in tones and present at all points throughout the switch’s stroke.\n\nContext For being as functionally similar to Cherry’s MX Ergo Clear switches as these are, this initial short run of switches at a slightly elevated price point of $0.61/switch feels uncharacteristically gimmicky for a Cherry switch release. While it has obvious historical implications and the potential for sustained growth in the future, as is the Cherry MX Purples just feel… non-special.\n\nOther The biggest value to be had of Cherry MX Purples is that their success signals a new, potentially more community collaborative era of Cherry ahead. Functionally these don’t offer anything at all that we don’t already have except for a chance at a greater future switch design potential.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX Brown Last Update: 03/14/2021\n\nNotes Push Feel Stock Cherry switches, in general, don’t tend to be all that great relatively speaking and MX Browns do it no favors. Between the aggressive scratch, ping-like feeling due to the leaf, and non-cohesive bump, it’s hard to give this a much higher score. The biggest savior of these switches, by far, is it’s iconic low-tactility bump and the rock-solid bottoming/topping out.\n\nWobble While I stated in the long-form review that wobble is highly variable across the years of MX Brown production, the average switch I’ve tried has a slight bit of E/W top housing wobble and noticeable stem wobble. The stem wobble also has a stronger E/W wobble than N/S.\n\nSound The sound, overall, really isn’t great in this switch and it is very much a mirror of the push feel. There is an overwhelmingly rough scratch sound that sits on top of a slight ping at higher activation speeds and a jagged tactile bump sound.\n\nContext Say what you want about this score. These have been insanely prevalent in this community since it’s inception, they’re widely available, cheap, and the entry point for so many enthusiasts into this hobby. While they could be a bit better about quality, there’s no arguing that these are contextually one of the most important switches of the modern era.\n\nOther It’s really hard to really quantify the value of these switches or even their performance relative to other switches given how much of a ‘baseline’ they’ve been not only for myself but for everyone for some time. While they do provide good memes in and of themselves, I truly think MX Browns deserve more recognition than they get when viewed as a whole.\n\nGOAT"

Mr LEUNG pointed out that the Seventh LegCo had bid farewell to internal attrition and restored rationality. He said it was expected that by the summer recess in mid-July, LegCo would have passed 75 bills, an increase of 35% compared to the same period in the previous term. Additionally, it was anticipated that 186 financial proposals, with a total commitment of over $500 billion, would have been approved by mid-July, reflecting an 11% increase compared to the same period in the previous term. The results are a testament to the proactive pragmatism of Members.\\xa0\\nMr LEUNG said the Chief Executive, Mr John LEE Ka-chiu, driven by his strong sense of responsibility, proposed in March this year to enact legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law. The bill, after scrutiny by LegCo, was subsequently passed, plugging the loophole in national security in the Hong Kong SAR and enabling Hong Kong to concentrate on its efforts on breaking new ground.\\n\\xa0\\nMr LEUNG stressed, “Since the early years of Hong Kong, the city has been evolving and advancing on an ever-changing track. From need to change, from change to solution, unfazed by change and dare to change are in Hong Kong’s DNA for success.” He pointed out that LegCo, as an integral member of “patriots administering Hong Kong”, shall spare no effort in assisting the SAR Government in assembling constructive forces to drive Hong Kong’s development.

        "Cherry MX2A RGB Blue Last Update: 09/03/2023\n\nNotes Push Feel For all of the changes made to the molds and designs by Cherry for their MX2A switch platform, the RGB Blues appear to have benefitted the least from these changes. Partly due to their click jacket mechanism and partly due to not receiving any factory lube around their bottom housing ‘socket dome’, these Blues feel crunchy, plasticky, and wholly inconsistent. Their only saving grace in terms of the push feeling is the subtly and fairly firm bottoming out in these switches.\n\nWobble The Cherry MX2A RGB Blues have a slightly greater E/W direction stem wobble than N/S direction that is almost certainly not likely to notice the majority of keyboard enthusiasts. As well, the noted top housing budging in the Cherry MX2A RGB Blacks is also seen here across the full batch of Blues which I received.\n\nSound This section may as well be copied and pasted from any other click jacket clicky switch scorecard I’ve had posted to date. While these switches are seemingly devoid of noise in the housing collisions and don’t have a scratchy tone to their stroke, the mechanism in and of itself provides enough plasticky, grinding, and utterly unpredictable chaos to the switch that shows that even this mechanism has yet to be improved by Cherry decades after it was first implemented.\n\nContext While Cherry does deserve some credit for the changes that were made to the MX2A line as a whole, as well as their implied long-term support for this switch platform, uncertainty as to the price point of these switches remains a big question determining their future success.\n\nOther For all the changes that were made in the MX2A platform launch, the MX2A Blues are severely lacking in the dedicated, mechanism-intensive upgrades they’ve been needing for some years.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX2A RGB Black Last Update: 08/27/2023\n\nNotes Push Feel Boasting new factory lubrication in the bottom housings as well as internal tweaks to reduce friction, the stock Cherry MX2A RGB Black switches are slightly smoother than their MX predecessors while still having a decent amount of medium-grain scratch. Concentrated at the upper portions of the stroke due the factory lubrication in the base of the bottom housings, the stroke is subtly two-toned in feeling which is only further accentuated by a slightly firmer bottoming out than topping out housing collision. The noted disparities here both do improve with breaking in and aftermarket modification as well as get worse at higher actuation speeds.\n\nWobble Clearly made from different molds than the Cherry MX ‘New Nixies’, the MX2A RGB Blacks have a greater E/W direction stem wobble than N/S direction which likely won’t bother the majority of keyboard enthusiasts. As well, there is the tiniest of top housing budges in both directions which is unlikely to affect their general day-to-day usage but is still worth noting.\n\nSound The sound is perhaps the worst aspect of the Cherry MX2A RGB Black switches, as the two-tone stroke and scratch sounds are incredibly apparent in stock form and become increasingly more aggressive at higher actuation speeds. That being said, though, the housing collisions are at least fairly muted and the switches seem free from high-pitched, metallic ping across any batch.\n\nContext With some uncertainty as to their explicit price point, there is some question as to how prevalent these will be within the custom community. What is not up for debate, though, is the longevity and implied company backing. Even if small, Cherry has clearly dedicated themselves to the MX2A changes and should be applauded for the transparency with such.\n\nOther While the MX2A changes are subtle in magnitude, they speak volumes for the large changes Cherry is willing to make to improve their otherwise untouched golden product line.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX ‘New Nixie’ (Black Clear-Top) Last Update: 12/04/2022\n\nNotes Push Feel This is perhaps the singular scorecard which has made me question my decision to not include break in notes in the overall scores. That being said, out of the box the Cherry MX ‘New Nixies’ are an all-around improved version of the average Cherry linear. Very small grain scratch size as well as a firm, muted bottoming out are on par with the average linear switch as of the time of this review, with the slightly less firm, plasticky topping out providing a bit of a different feel.\n\nWobble The wobble, both in terms of single-switch and batch-wide performances is quite damn impressive by Cherry. Little stem wobble in the E/W and even less in the N/S direction provides an experience that very few if anyone in the community would likely have an issue with.\n\nSound While Cherry has done well to remove their classically expected trait of spring ping via the addition of a slightly lubed spring base from the factory, the out of the box sound is still a bit marred from the thinner topping out and scratchy sound. These definitely sound like a lighter, less robust and developed Cherry MX Black out of the box.\n\nContext Priced at a pretty reasonable for time of release $0.60 per switch, these have all the making of a cornerstone, history defining moment in switch history. Their widespread stock, insane community hype, and momentous release from a manufacturer who hasn’t engaged the niche hobby like this ever before will likely see hundreds upon thousands of custom boards built with these switches in the years to come, even if they aren’t the absolute best performing switches.\n\nOther The hype buildup, the noted deliberate improvements by Cherry, and the first of a kind engagement with the community makes these switches ones that won’t be forgotten. I can’t think of any switch, any release, or any story as big as this has been in switch history.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX Purple Last Update: 01/07/2024\n\nNotes Push Feel Modeled directly after the stems used in Cherry MX Clear switches, the MX Purples have a medium strength tactile bump that is on the shorter end of width and located about 30% of the way into downstroke of the switch. Capped on either end of this stroke by dampened, thick housing collisions, the MX Purples are a well-insulated, incredibly inoffensive medium tactile switch that is very much in line with tropes common to Cherry’s switches – including a leathery scratch feeling that is present even behind Cherry’s MX2A lubrication process.\n\nWobble With ever so slightly improved mold designs and tolerances in line with other Cherry MX2A switches, the MX Purples have a decent amount of E/W direction stem wobble and a lesser N/S direction wobble. It’s not likely to bother most users except those most sensitive to wobble.\n\nSound Much like the push feeling notes above, the Cherry MX Purples are on the much more muted, subtle, and dampened side and hardly make much noise at all. What sound is present besides the thuds at bottoming and topping out are that of a medium grained scratch that is leathery in tones and present at all points throughout the switch’s stroke.\n\nContext For being as functionally similar to Cherry’s MX Ergo Clear switches as these are, this initial short run of switches at a slightly elevated price point of $0.61/switch feels uncharacteristically gimmicky for a Cherry switch release. While it has obvious historical implications and the potential for sustained growth in the future, as is the Cherry MX Purples just feel… non-special.\n\nOther The biggest value to be had of Cherry MX Purples is that their success signals a new, potentially more community collaborative era of Cherry ahead. Functionally these don’t offer anything at all that we don’t already have except for a chance at a greater future switch design potential.\n\nGOAT",
        "Cherry MX Brown Last Update: 03/14/2021\n\nNotes Push Feel Stock Cherry switches, in general, don’t tend to be all that great relatively speaking and MX Browns do it no favors. Between the aggressive scratch, ping-like feeling due to the leaf, and non-cohesive bump, it’s hard to give this a much higher score. The biggest savior of these switches, by far, is it’s iconic low-tactility bump and the rock-solid bottoming/topping out.\n\nWobble While I stated in the long-form review that wobble is highly variable across the years of MX Brown production, the average switch I’ve tried has a slight bit of E/W top housing wobble and noticeable stem wobble. The stem wobble also has a stronger E/W wobble than N/S.\n\nSound The sound, overall, really isn’t great in this switch and it is very much a mirror of the push feel. There is an overwhelmingly rough scratch sound that sits on top of a slight ping at higher activation speeds and a jagged tactile bump sound.\n\nContext Say what you want about this score. These have been insanely prevalent in this community since it’s inception, they’re widely available, cheap, and the entry point for so many enthusiasts into this hobby. While they could be a bit better about quality, there’s no arguing that these are contextually one of the most important switches of the modern era.\n\nOther It’s really hard to really quantify the value of these switches or even their performance relative to other switches given how much of a ‘baseline’ they’ve been not only for myself but for everyone for some time. While they do provide good memes in and of themselves, I truly think MX Browns deserve more recognition than they get when viewed as a whole.\n\nGOAT"
